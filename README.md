# Simple Require

require.js is amazing, but sometimes you just want simple deferred loading. This does that in 40loc.

## gotchas

This doesn't do async, builds, optimizations, or anything like that. Also doesn't do bi-directional associations, but since those are a design smell anyways, I have managed to get away so far without adding them in (if you introduce one, you will get a stack overflow exception).

## usage

Simple require will introduce two globals -- `require` and `define`. Module definitions are executed (and memoized) when first required. To reset the cached definitions (this is sometimes needed in test code, but should NEVER be needed in production code!!), invoke `define._clearCaches()`.

```javascript
// simple usage

define("some-module", function(module){
  module.exports = {
    a: 1,
    b: 2
  }
});

console.log(require('some-module').a) // => 1


// when you are returning a bag of functions, you may just want to use exports

define("some-module", function(module, exports){
  exports.foo = function(){
    return "HI"
  }
});

console.log(require('some-module').foo()) // => "HI"
```
